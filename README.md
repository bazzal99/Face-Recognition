# Face-Recognition


Frst of all in order to recognize a face , we have implement a function that detect the face from the image.

Then we will use face detection to train our model if the dataset is group of images.If it is group of faces we just train our model randomly.

Finall we take a screenshot from the camera each batch of ms, predict the test face after detecting it, if the confidence higher than the thresold, apply the changes.
